## ✨ What's This?

This is my personal portfolio — not your average developer website. I wanted something that felt like *me*: a bit retro, a bit bold, and definitely not boring.

The design is inspired by pixel art and arcade aesthetics. Think NES meets modern web development. Scanlines, glow effects, and that satisfying chunky pixel shadow on everything.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Next.js 15** — App Router, server components, the whole modern React stack
- **React 19** — Latest and greatest
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling with CSS variables
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations and scroll-triggered reveals
- **Radix UI** — Accessible component primitives
- **TypeScript** — Because I like my errors at compile time, not production

## 🎨 Features

- **Retro Pixel Art Aesthetic** — Custom scanline effects, pixel shadows, and arcade-inspired UI
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Toggle between themes, persisted in localStorage
- **Typing Animation** — Hero section with that classic terminal feel
- **Animated Skills Ticker** — Because static skill lists are boring
- **Project Gallery with Modals** — Click to dive deeper into each project
- **Responsive Design** — Looks good on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors
- **One-Click Contact** — Email link opens your default mail app, ready to send

## 👋 About Me

I'm Gabriel — a software engineer based in Spain who enjoys turning chaos into useful software. My work spans LLM pipelines, full-stack web apps, NLP research, and automation tools.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably learning a new language (the human kind) or hunting for the perfect café in a new city.
